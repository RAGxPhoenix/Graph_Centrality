# Graph_Centrality

🌐 Graph Centrality: Unlocking the Heart of Networks! 🔍

Welcome to Graph_Centrality – your ultimate toolkit for uncovering the most influential nodes in massive graphs! 🚀 This project dives deep into the world of network analysis, comparing various centrality techniques to find the best approach for identifying key players in complex networks. Whether you're studying social networks, infrastructure systems, or biological graphs, this repo has you covered with code, comparisons, and a detailed report! 🌟
📝 About the Project
Graph_Centrality is all about detecting the central nodes that hold networks together. We’ve explored and compared multiple centrality measures (Degree, Betweenness, Closeness, Eigenvector, and more) to see which shines brightest for large-scale graphs. Our detailed report breaks down the results, offering insights for researchers, data scientists, and network enthusiasts!

Tech Stack: Python, NetworkX, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Jupyter for analysis and visualization. 🛠️
Goal: Discover the best centrality techniques for large graphs and make network analysis accessible! 📊
